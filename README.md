This project is a restaurant menu card.


I started by creating the basic structure using HTML.

JavaScript and jQuery were then used to fetch menu data from an external API and display it on the page.
The data handling was separated into multiple functions to keep the code readable and maintainable.
Loops were used to add each menu item. DOM was manipulated with innerHTML to render the content

I used CSS to style and position the content, resulting in a clean and user-friendly layout.


learned:
- working with jQuery and JSON. 
- organizing code with functions.
- loop to add specific data for each function to the menu.
- using DOM to render content.
